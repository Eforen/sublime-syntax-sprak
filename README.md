# Sublime Språk Syntax
SublimeText Syntax Definitions for Språk the language used in the game Else Heart.Break()

#### File Naming Convention
I have gone with the naming convention of *.sprak if you feel that I should use another naming convention please contact me and I would be pleased to discuse it with you.

#### Me
I have no affiliation with the game nor its author if anything is incompleate or incorrect that is on me as it is my work seen here. In that very posible case I am very sorry this is only a hobby afterall.

#### The Game Else Heart.Break()
The award winning game [else Heart.Break()](http://elseheartbreak.com/) uses a language called Språk ingame to allow the player to hack computers and "Stuff" (You will see if you play the game, and if your looking for this you likely already know)

#### Why
Well I like programming in Sublime Text 3 and the game allows you to copy and paste in and out code from the game so I wanted to beable to do so and still have text highlighting and code hints but with compleation aswell

#### What
This Package contains both a syntax Highlighter and some but not all compleations in a robust form.

#### Help
Please feel free to fork this and then make a pull request when you add more code compleates to the library or enhance the syntax highlighter

#### Checked Devices / Known Functions (Included in completion)
